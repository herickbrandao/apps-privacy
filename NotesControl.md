# Notes Control - Privacy
This Privacy Policy is intended to clarify how user information is handled in the Notes app. Below, we explain what data is (and is not) collected and how this information is used.

## Data Collection
Our Notes app is designed to function offline, ensuring that no data related to your notes is collected or shared with third parties. All notes created and stored within the app remain on the user's device, with no external access.

The app uses advertisements to remain free, and the ads displayed are managed by Google AdMob, an ad platform by Google. This means that Google may collect certain user data to personalize and display relevant ads, in accordance with their own privacy policy.

Information Collected for Advertising
While the Notes app does not collect personal data or any information related to your notes, Google AdMob may collect different types of information.

## Device identifiers
Information about interactions with ads
App usage data (for ad display purposes only)
This information is exclusively managed by Google, and the Notes app does not have access to it. To learn more about how Google manages data, we encourage you to read the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

## Data Security
Your privacy is a priority. All data related to your notes is stored locally and securely on your device. There is no synchronization with external servers, ensuring that your information remains private.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legislation or the services we offer. Users will be notified of any significant changes through the app.
